# Demos

We've included a small sample of components in these docs to demonstrate Ardi's API. These range from very simple (a counter) to very complex (a keyboard with multiple instruments, recording and playback). Our hope is to give you the opportunity to see Ardi in action, get a feel for it, and decide if it's right for you.

You can choose any of these components to see a demo, example markup, and the Javascript source.
