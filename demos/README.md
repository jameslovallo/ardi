# Demos

We've included a small sample of components in these docs to demonstrate Ardi's API. These range from very simple (a counter) to very complex (a keyboard with multiple instruments, recording and playback). Our hope is to give you the opportunity to see Ardi in action, get a feel for it, and decide if it's right for you.

The demos below use an interactive playground (created with Ardi) that allows you to play with each component's props, if applicable. You can also view the Javascript source for each component.
